            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The chest muscles are made up of the pectoralis major and, underneath that, the pectoralis minor. Together they are often referred to as the "pecs." The pectoralis major is the larger muscle and has two partsâ€”an upper portion (called the clavicular head) and the lower portion (called the sternal head). The pectoralis minor is triangular in shape and works in tandem with the pectoralis major.</p>
            <h3>Reasons to workout the Bicep</h3>
            <p>The chest includes some of the largest muscles in the upper body and you use the chest muscles all day long. For example, the chest muscles are needed to push open a door, wash your hair, or get up and down from the floor. It's important to keep these muscles strong for all your daily activities. </p>
